This was a semester long project in a Database Systems course at the University of New Orleans. 

A database was implemented with hundreds of mock data entries to handle edge cases for all queries 
  written throughout the project. Many of the queries exemplify SQL division and the necessary use 
  of temporary tables utilizing with statements.
